What's in the new Georgia voting law (https://global-factiva-com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/ha/default.aspx#./!?&_suid=161825923530208684332934397712):

  - new stricter ID requirements for absentee ballots
      - the elector has to print the number of their Georgia license number of identification card on their absentee ballot
      - illegal for absentee ballot applications to be mailed out to all voters
      
  - the number of drop boxes were limited
      - one drop box for every 100k voters or one drop box for the number of advance voting locations in the country
            - there were 94 elections for the 2020 election in Fulton, Cobb, DeKalb, and Gwinnett counties (the four counties that make up the majority of Atlanta); with this new law, there will now be 23 drop boxes
      - drop boxes will be closed when advance voting is not being conducted, and they will be placed in government buildings or early-voting sites (thus not open during non-business hours)
      
  - mobile voting centers are outlawed unless there is some sort of emergency
      - 11,200 people voted at the two mobile voting centers in Fulton County in November of 2020
      - the only way for this practice to be carried out in the future is if a state of emergency is declared by the government, which is highly unlikely
      
  - there are new strict laws on early voting that describe that voting will be conducted from 9 AM to 5 PM, with very few exceptions
      - this hurts those who work daytime hours or who are unable to take time off of work in the middle of the day to vote
      - giving food and water to voters is a misdemeanor
      - it is now more challenging to extend the hours of voting, as they only may be extended by a judge

Georgia law: "A Georgia state driver's license number, ID card number, date of birth and the last four digits of a social security number or another approved form of identification must be printed on the outside of an absentee ballot" (https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/04/10/georgia-new-voting-law-explained/7133587002/)

In 2017, "Iowaâ€™s governor signed a broad-based law that will require voter ID, restrict voter registration efforts, and impose new burdens on Election Day registration and early and absentee voting. Although not as restrictive as a North Carolina law that passed in 2013. (https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-laws-roundup-2017)
  - what I am going to do is look at the difference in absentee ballot turnout in 2016 and 2018 and see the difference, and then say that the changes in Iowa are directly proportional to the changes in Georgia. Unfortunately, I could not get county-level data for Iowa, but the data is here: (https://ballotpedia.org/Analysis_of_absentee/mail-in_voting,_2016-2018)
  
Although a decrease in absentee ballots does not technically indicate a decrease in overall voter turnout, a large decrease in absentee ballots demonstrates low civic engagement, which then leads to a decrease in total voter turnout. In Iowa. the decrease in voter turnout was 247,092 between 2016-2018, which is certainly substantial, even though 2016 was a presidential election year and 2018 was a midterm election year. Between the two elections (i.e. 2016 and 2018), the Iowa voter turnout decreased by 15.6%, which is actually a standard drop in voter participation (https://www.fairvote.org/voter_turnout). If we assume that Georgia's voter turnout is directly proportional to Iowa's, then the state's turnout in the 2022 midterm elections will be 15.6% lower than the turnout from the 2020 election. In the most recent presidential election, 4,999,960 votes were cast in Georgia (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-georgia.html), with being absentee ballots amounting to 1,323,748 of those votes. (https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-elections/georgia-results).
